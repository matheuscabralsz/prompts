# Detailed Step Planning Template

## Purpose
Break down any phase or step into detailed, actionable documentation before coding begins. Each step should be as independent as possible with explicit prerequisites.

## Context
Use this to create detailed implementation documentation for any step in your project, whether from a high-level plan (planning.md) or a standalone task. This is still planning - no code is written yet. The goal is to have a clear, detailed roadmap that can be executed independently.

## Pre-requirements (Optional)
- If breaking down phases from a high-level plan, complete `planning.md` first
- If this is a standalone step, no prior planning needed

## Prompt
```
Let's create detailed documentation for this specific step before we begin coding.

**Current Step: [Step/Phase Number and Name]**

Before we dive in:

1. **Prerequisites Check:**
   - Does this step require other steps to be completed first?
   - If YES: List them explicitly: "Prerequisites: Step [N] - [Name], Step [M] - [Name]"
   - If NO: State "Prerequisites: None (can start independently)"

2. **Clarifying Questions:**
   - Do you have any questions about the requirements or approach?
   - Should we adjust the scope based on what we've learned so far?

Once we're aligned, please provide detailed documentation for this step:

**Prerequisites:**
[List specific steps/phases that must be complete, OR state "None"]

**Tasks:**
- List of specific tasks to complete
- Order of operations
- Note any tasks that can be done in parallel

**Files:**
- Files that need to be created
- Files that need to be modified
- What each file should contain (high-level)
- Any file dependencies (e.g., "requires config.json to exist first")

**Dependencies & Integrations:**
- External libraries or packages needed
- APIs or services to integrate
- Other systems or components this step interacts with

**Testing:**
- What tests need to be written (unit, integration, e2e)
- Key test scenarios to cover
- Test data or fixtures needed

**Configuration:**
- Environment setup required
- Configuration files to create/modify
- Secrets or credentials needed

**Validation:**
- How to verify this step is complete
- What tests should pass
- What the build should produce
- Expected outputs or artifacts

**Independent Verification:**
How can someone verify this step is complete without knowledge of other steps?

Please provide the detailed documentation for this step only.

After documenting all steps, use `progress-tracking.md` to create a progress tracker in docs/PROGRESS.md for monitoring implementation.
```

## Expected Output
For each step, detailed documentation that includes:
1. Explicit prerequisites (or "None" if independent)
2. Clarifying questions (if needed)
3. Complete task breakdown with parallel opportunities noted
4. File-level changes with dependencies
5. External dependencies and integrations
6. Testing requirements
7. Configuration needs
8. Independent validation criteria

**This does NOT include actual code implementation.**

## Notes
- Steps should be independent unless explicitly stated otherwise
- Always document prerequisites at the start (or state "None")
- Each step can be documented and executed independently if no prerequisites exist
- Independent steps can be worked on in parallel
- This is documentation/planning phase, not coding phase
- User specifies which step/phase to break down
- After documentation is complete, create a progress tracker using `progress-tracking.md`
- Use a separate prompt to begin actual coding after planning and tracking setup

## Example Usage

**Independent Step (no prerequisites):**
```
Let's break down: Database Schema Design

Prerequisites: None (can start independently)
[... detailed documentation ...]
```

**Dependent Step:**
```
Let's break down: User Authentication API

Prerequisites:
- Phase 1: Database Schema Design must be complete
- Phase 2: User Model Implementation must be complete

[... detailed documentation ...]
```

After documenting all steps, move to coding phase with a different prompt.
