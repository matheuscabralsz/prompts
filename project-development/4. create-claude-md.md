# Create CLAUDE.md File

## Purpose
Generate a CLAUDE.md file for a new project based on the initial idea and planning documentation, providing Claude Code with clear guidance for implementing the project.

## Context
Use this after completing the planning and progress tracking documentation. This prompt creates the CLAUDE.md file that will guide Claude Code throughout the implementation process.

## Pre-requirements
- Completed initial-idea.md in docs/ folder
- Completed planning.md (step 1)
- Completed PROGRESS.md via progress-tracking.md (step 3)

## Prompt
```
I'm starting a new project and need you to create a CLAUDE.md file that will guide you when implementing it.

Read the project documentation that I've created:
- docs/initial-idea.md - The project concept and requirements
- docs/planning.md - The implementation plan with phases
- docs/PROGRESS.md - The progress tracker

Based on this documentation, create a `.claude/CLAUDE.md` file (create the `.claude/` directory if needed) that includes:

1. **Repository Purpose**: Summary from initial-idea.md - what this project does and its main goals

2. **Project Structure**: The planned directory layout based on the technology stack and architecture defined in initial-idea.md

3. **Technology Stack**: Languages, frameworks, and key dependencies from initial-idea.md

4. **Development Workflow**:
   - How to build and run the project (based on the tech stack)
   - Testing approach defined in initial-idea.md
   - Quality gates from planning.md

5. **Implementation Phases**: Reference to the phases defined in planning.md with their dependencies

6. **Coding Conventions**:
   - Style guidelines appropriate for the tech stack
   - Architectural patterns from initial-idea.md
   - Best practices for the chosen technologies

7. **File Organization**: Where different types of files should go based on the project structure

8. **Important Principles**: Key guidelines from initial-idea.md that must be followed during implementation

Make the CLAUDE.md:
- **Specific to this project**: Use actual details from the documentation
- **Actionable**: Provide clear, concrete guidance for implementation
- **Aligned with planning**: Reference the phases and approach from planning.md
- **Tech-appropriate**: Include conventions specific to the technology stack
- **Quality-focused**: Emphasize the quality gates and testing requirements

Save the file to `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
```

## Expected Output
A project-specific CLAUDE.md file at `.claude/CLAUDE.md` that includes:
- Project purpose and goals from initial-idea.md
- Planned directory structure appropriate for the tech stack
- Technology stack and dependencies
- Development workflow (build, test, run)
- Reference to implementation phases from planning.md
- Coding conventions for the specific technologies
- File organization principles
- Quality gates and important principles

## Notes
- **Workflow position**: This is step 4 - run this after completing initial-idea.md, planning.md, and PROGRESS.md
- **Living document**: Update CLAUDE.md as the project evolves and patterns emerge during implementation
- **Planning reference**: The CLAUDE.md should reference the planning.md phases to guide implementation order
- **Tech-specific**: Conventions should match the chosen technology stack (React patterns for React projects, Go idioms for Go projects, etc.)
- **No code yet**: Remember this is documentation only - no code exists yet, only plans
- **Ready to code**: After creating CLAUDE.md, all planning documentation is complete and you can begin implementation

### Next Steps
After creating CLAUDE.md:
1. All planning documentation is complete
2. Begin implementation following the phases in planning.md
3. Track progress using PROGRESS.md
4. Update CLAUDE.md if new conventions or patterns emerge
