# Project Planning Template

## Purpose
Generate high-level project documentation with actionable, independent phases for new projects.

## Context
Use this at the start of any new project to create a structured implementation plan. This provides the roadmap before diving into detailed implementation. Each phase should be as independent as possible to allow parallel work and flexible execution.

## Pre-requirements
Create the initial idea of your project inside docs/initial-idea.md

## Prompt
```
Read the docs/initial-idea.md file and create a high-level implementation plan for this project with the following structure:

**Project Overview:**
- Brief description of what we're building
- Key objectives and success criteria
- Tech stack and architecture approach

**Implementation Phases:**
Break down the project into logical, independent phases. For each phase:
- Clear milestone and deliverable
- Actionable steps within the phase (high-level only)
- **EXPLICIT dependencies:** If this phase depends on another phase, state: "Prerequisites: Phase [N] - [Name]"
- **If no dependencies:** State "Prerequisites: None (can start independently)"
- Estimated complexity (simple/moderate/complex)

**Phase Independence:**
- Design phases to be as independent as possible
- Phases with no dependencies can be worked on in parallel
- Only create dependencies when absolutely necessary
- Group dependent steps within the same phase when possible

**Quality Gates:**
For each phase:
- Tests must pass (unit, integration, e2e as applicable)
- Build must succeed
- If phase has prerequisites, those must be complete and validated first

**Deliverables:**
What should exist at the end of each phase? Be specific so progress can be verified independently.

Keep everything at a high level - we'll develop detailed implementation later. Focus on the logical flow and what needs to be accomplished, not how.

After creating this plan, use `progress-tracking.md` to generate a progress tracker in docs/PROGRESS.md for monitoring implementation status.
```

## Expected Output
A structured, high-level plan with:
- Clear, independent phases where possible
- Explicit dependency declarations for each phase (or "None")
- Actionable steps within each phase
- Quality gates (tests and build) for validation
- Flexible execution order based on dependencies

## Notes
- Phases should be independent unless explicitly stated otherwise
- Dependencies should only be created when truly necessary
- Independent phases can be worked on in parallel or in any order
- Emphasizes test-driven development and continuous integration
- Keep steps at a high level; detailed implementation comes later
- Useful for both greenfield projects and major feature additions
- After completing this plan, create a progress tracker using `progress-tracking.md`
