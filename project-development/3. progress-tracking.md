# Progress Tracking Template

## Purpose
Track feature completion status and implementation progress for project phases and steps. Provides a visual checklist of what's done and what's remaining.

## Context
Use this after creating your high-level plan (planning.md). This document helps you track progress during actual implementation and serves as a quick reference for project status.

## Pre-requirements
- Complete `planning.md` for high-level phases and steps

## Prompt
```
Based on the planning document (planning.md), create a progress tracking document in docs/PROGRESS.md with the following structure:

# Project Progress Tracker

## Overview
- **Project Name:** [Project Name from initial-idea.md]
- **Last Updated:** [Date]
- **Overall Status:** [X/Y phases complete]

## Progress Checklist

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]
**Prerequisites:** [None OR list prerequisites]
**Status:** [ ] Not Started / [~] In Progress / [✓] Complete

- [ ] Step 1: [Step name/description]
  - [ ] Subtask 1
  - [ ] Subtask 2
- [ ] Step 2: [Step name/description]
  - [ ] Subtask 1

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Code reviewed (if applicable)

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]
**Prerequisites:** [None OR list prerequisites]
**Status:** [ ] Not Started / [~] In Progress / [✓] Complete

- [ ] Step 1: [Step name/description]

[Continue for all phases...]

## Completion Summary
- Total Phases: [N]
- Completed: [X]
- In Progress: [Y]
- Not Started: [Z]

## Notes
- Use [✓] for completed items
- Use [~] for in-progress items
- Use [ ] for not started items
- Update dates when status changes
- Track blockers or issues in a separate section if needed
```

## Expected Output
A markdown checklist document in the project's `docs/` folder that:
1. Lists all phases and steps from planning documents
2. Shows completion status with checkboxes
3. Includes prerequisites for each phase
4. Tracks quality gates (tests, build, review)
5. Provides a summary of overall progress
6. Can be easily updated as work progresses

## Notes
- Keep this document in your project's `docs/` folder (not in the prompts repository)
- Update regularly as you complete tasks
- Use consistent checkbox notation: `[ ]` for incomplete, `[✓]` for complete, `[~]` for in-progress
- This document complements your planning docs - it tracks execution, not planning
- Link back to detailed documentation for implementation details
- Can be used for both full projects and individual features
