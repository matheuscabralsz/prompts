# Initial Project Idea Template

## Purpose
Document the initial concept and requirements for a new project before starting the planning phase. This serves as the input for the project planning workflow.

## Context
Use this template at the very beginning of a new project, before running the planning workflow. Fill this out to capture your initial vision, requirements, and constraints. This document will be referenced during the planning phase to create a structured implementation plan.

## Template

### Brief Description
[2-3 sentences describing what you want to build and the problem it solves]

### Target Audience
[Who will use this? What are their needs?]

### Core Value Proposition
[What makes this project valuable? Why should it exist?]

---

## Functional Requirements

### Must Have (MVP)
- [ ] [Core feature 1]
- [ ] [Core feature 2]
- [ ] [Core feature 3]

### Should Have (Post-MVP)
- [ ] [Important but not critical feature 1]
- [ ] [Important but not critical feature 2]

### Nice to Have (Future)
- [ ] [Optional enhancement 1]
- [ ] [Optional enhancement 2]

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- [Expected response times, load capacity, etc.]

### Security
- [Authentication needs, data protection, compliance requirements]

### Scalability
- [Expected user base, growth expectations]

### Availability
- [Uptime requirements, maintenance windows]

### Compatibility
- [Browser support, device support, OS requirements]

---

## Technical Constraints

### Preferred Tech Stack

### Budget
[Any budget considerations for infrastructure, services, etc.]

### Team
[Solo project, team size, expertise available]

### Dependencies
[Any external APIs, services, or systems to integrate with]

---

## Success Criteria

### Launch Criteria
[What needs to be true for v1.0 to launch?]

### Success Metrics
- [Metric 1: e.g., User acquisition target]
- [Metric 2: e.g., Performance benchmark]
- [Metric 3: e.g., User satisfaction score]

---

## Additional Context

### Inspiration
[Similar projects, competitors, or inspirations]

### Known Risks
[Technical challenges, market risks, or concerns]

### Open Questions
[Things you're unsure about or need to research]

## Next Steps
Once this document is complete, proceed to the project planning workflow:
1. Use `project-development/1. planning.md` to create high-level plan
2. Use `project-development/2. detailed-planning-implementation.md` for detailed breakdown

---

## Notes
- Fill out all sections as completely as possible, but it's okay to mark items as "flexible" or "TBD"
- The more detailed this document, the better the planning phase will be
- Update this document as your understanding of the project evolves
- This is a living document - revisit it when requirements change
