# Project Implementation Workflow

## Purpose
Break down each phase from project-planning.md into detailed, step-by-step documentation before any coding begins.

## Context
Use this after completing project-planning.md to create detailed implementation documentation for each step. This is still planning - no code is written yet. The goal is to have a clear, detailed roadmap before implementation starts.

## Prompt
```
We have a high-level project plan. Let's create detailed documentation for this specific step before we begin coding.

**Current Step: [Step Number and Name]**

Let's break down this step into detailed documentation. Before we dive in:

1. Do you have any questions about the requirements or approach?
2. Are there any dependencies or prerequisites we need to address first?
3. Should we adjust the scope based on what we've learned so far?

Once we're aligned, please provide detailed documentation for this step:

**Tasks:**
- List of specific tasks to complete
- Order of operations

**Files:**
- Files that need to be created
- Files that need to be modified
- What each file should contain (high-level)

**Testing:**
- What tests need to be written (unit, integration, e2e)
- Key test scenarios to cover

**Configuration:**
- Any setup, dependencies, or configuration needed

**Validation:**
- How to verify this step is complete
- What tests should pass
- What the build should produce

Please provide the detailed documentation for this step only.
```

## Expected Output
For each step, detailed documentation that includes:
1. Clarifying questions (if needed)
2. Complete task breakdown
3. File-level changes needed
4. Testing requirements
5. Validation criteria

**This does NOT include actual code implementation.**

## Notes
- This is documentation/planning phase, not coding phase
- User specifies which step/phase to break down
- Always start with "Let's break down Step [N]: [Name]"
- Pause for questions before creating the detailed docs
- Each step is documented individually as needed
- After documentation is complete, you'll use a separate prompt to begin coding

## Example Usage
**Planning Phase (this prompt):**
```
Let's break down Step 0: Project Foundation Setup. Do you have any questions before we dive in?
```

After documenting all steps, move to coding phase with a different prompt.
