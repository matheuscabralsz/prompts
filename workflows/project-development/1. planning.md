# Project Planning Template

## Purpose
Generate high-level project documentation with actionable steps for new projects.

## Context
Use this at the start of any new project to create a structured implementation plan. This provides the roadmap before diving into detailed implementation.

## Pre-requirements
Create the initial idea of your project inside docs/INITIAL_IDEA.md

## Prompt
```
Read the docs/INITIAL_IDEA.md file and create a high-level implementation plan for this project with the following structure:

**Project Overview:**
- Brief description of what we're building
- Key objectives and success criteria
- Tech stack and architecture approach

**Implementation Phases:**
Break down the project into logical phases with:
- Clear milestones for each phase
- Actionable steps within each phase (high-level only)
- Dependencies between steps
- Estimated complexity (simple/moderate/complex)

**Quality Gates:**
For each step:
- Tests must pass (unit, integration, e2e as applicable)
- Build must succeed
- No step should proceed if the previous step has failures

**Deliverables:**
What should exist at the end of each phase?

Keep everything at a high level - we'll develop detailed implementation later. Focus on the logical flow and what needs to be accomplished, not how.
```

## Expected Output
A structured, high-level plan with:
- Clear phases or milestones
- Actionable steps within each phase
- Quality gates (tests and build) between steps
- Logical progression that can be executed incrementally

## Notes
- This is a gating approach - each step must be complete and validated before proceeding
- Emphasizes test-driven development and continuous integration
- Keep steps at a high level; detailed implementation comes later
- Useful for both greenfield projects and major feature additions
