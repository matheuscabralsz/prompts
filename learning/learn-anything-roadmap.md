# Learn Anything Roadmap

> **Get a complete expert roadmap for any subject with phases, milestones, and validation checkpoints**

## Purpose

This prompt generates a comprehensive, phase-based learning roadmap that takes you from beginner to expert in any subject. Unlike detailed courses, this provides the "big picture" - showing you the complete journey, key milestones, time estimates, and validation points for each phase.

## Context

**Use this prompt when you want to:**
- Understand the complete learning path before diving deep
- Plan your learning journey over weeks or months
- Identify where you currently are and what comes next
- See what skills are needed at each level of expertise
- Get a strategic overview before committing to intensive study

**Perfect for:**
- Long-term skill development (1-12+ months)
- Career transitions requiring new expertise
- Understanding the scope of a complex field
- Planning self-directed learning paths
- Setting realistic expectations and timelines

**Complements:** `learn-anything.md` (use that for detailed, day-by-day intensive courses)

## Prerequisites

None. This prompt works for complete beginners or those looking to map their path to expertise.

## Follow-Up Prompts

Once you have your roadmap, use these prompts to refine and navigate:

**Adjust for your current level:**
```
I actually have some experience with [specific skills]. Can you adjust the
roadmap to account for this and tell me which phase I should start at?
```

**Deep dive into a phase:**
```
Can you expand Phase [X] with more detailed weekly breakdown and
specific resources I should use? Include a week-by-week plan.
```

**Validate your current level:**
```
I think I'm at [level], but I'm not sure. Can you give me a detailed
assessment test or project that will definitively show which phase I'm at?
```

**Adjust timeline:**
```
I can only dedicate [X] hours per week. Can you recalculate the
timeline for each phase based on this time commitment?
```

**Get specific resources:**
```
For Phase [X], can you recommend specific courses, books, or
tutorials with links? Prioritize free/affordable resources.
```

**Focus on weak areas:**
```
I'm struggling with [specific skill in current phase]. Can you create
a mini-roadmap just for mastering this skill with practice exercises?
```

**Check progress:**
```
I've completed [list of things]. Based on this, where am I on the roadmap?
What should I focus on next?
```

**Get project ideas:**
```
Can you suggest 3-5 project ideas for Phase [X] that would really
demonstrate competence at this level? Include project descriptions
and key features to implement.
```

**Career-focused guidance:**
```
At which phase am I ready to start applying for jobs? What should
my portfolio look like at that point?
```

**Overcome plateaus:**
```
I've been stuck at [phase/skill] for a while. What are advanced
techniques or different approaches I can use to break through?
```

## Tips for Success

### Before You Start

- **Be honest about current level** - Accurate self-assessment leads to better roadmaps
- **Set realistic time commitments** - Consistency matters more than intensity
- **Define clear success criteria** - Know what "job-ready" or "proficient" means
- **Understand the full journey** - Read the entire roadmap before starting

### Using Your Roadmap

- **Focus on one phase at a time** - Don't skip ahead
- **Complete validation checkpoints** - Ensure mastery before advancing
- **Build the milestone projects** - Theory without practice doesn't stick
- **Track your progress** - Use the success metrics and self-assessments
- **Revisit and adjust** - Roadmaps should evolve as you learn

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Don't do this:**
- âœ— Rushing through phases without validation
- âœ— Skipping beginner fundamentals
- âœ— Learning without building projects
- âœ— Ignoring prerequisites
- âœ— Comparing your timeline to others
- âœ— Giving up during plateau phases

**Do this instead:**
- âœ“ Master fundamentals completely
- âœ“ Build projects at every phase
- âœ“ Validate skills before advancing
- âœ“ Adjust timeline based on your progress
- âœ“ Accept that plateaus are normal
- âœ“ Focus on consistent daily/weekly practice

### Maximizing Effectiveness

1. **Combine with intensive learning**: Use `learn-anything.md` for focused deep-dives on specific phase topics
2. **Share your roadmap**: Accountability partners help you stay on track
3. **Join communities**: Connect with others at your phase level
4. **Document your journey**: Blog, tweet, or journal about your progress
5. **Review quarterly**: Check if you're on track and adjust as needed

### When to Update Your Roadmap

**Revisit and regenerate when:**
- You complete a major phase
- Your available time changes significantly
- You discover new interests or specializations
- Industry standards or technologies shift
- You're consistently ahead or behind schedule
- Your goals change (hobby â†’ career, or vice versa)

## Integration with Other Prompts

### Use with `learn-anything.md`

**The Roadmap â†’ Course Pipeline:**

1. **Use roadmap first** to understand the complete journey
2. **Identify current phase** using validation checkpoints
3. **For each topic in your current phase**, use `learn-anything.md` to create intensive focused courses
4. **Complete projects** from both the roadmap and intensive courses
5. **Validate competency** using roadmap checkpoints
6. **Advance to next phase** and repeat

**Example workflow:**
```
1. Generate roadmap for "Data Science"
2. Roadmap shows Phase 1: Python fundamentals, Statistics basics, NumPy/Pandas
3. Use learn-anything.md for intensive 3-day Python course
4. Use learn-anything.md for 2-day Statistics course
5. Use learn-anything.md for 2-day NumPy/Pandas course
6. Complete Phase 1 validation project from roadmap
7. Move to Phase 2: Machine Learning basics
8. Repeat the process
```
