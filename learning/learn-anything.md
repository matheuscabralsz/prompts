## Tips for Success

### Before You Start

- **Be specific** - "React hooks" works better than "React"
- **Set realistic time** - Intensive learning requires focus
- **Define clear goals** - Know what "success" looks like
- **Prepare your environment** - Quiet space, note-taking tools ready

### During the Course

- **Complete all exercises** - Don't skip the practice
- **Ask questions** - Use follow-up prompts when confused
- **Take notes** - The AI won't remember everything
- **Pace yourself** - Take breaks between modules
- **Be honest** - Tell the AI when you don't understand

### Getting the Best Results

**Do this:**
- ✓ Work through modules in order
- ✓ Complete exercises before moving on
- ✓ Ask for clarification immediately
- ✓ Request more examples when needed
- ✓ Do the final project

**Avoid this:**
- ✗ Rushing through without practice
- ✗ Skipping modules
- ✗ Saying you understand when you don't
- ✗ Not doing hands-on exercises
- ✗ Starting a new chat (you'll lose context)

### Troubleshooting

**"The AI is going too fast"**
→ Say: "This is moving too quickly. Can we slow down and add more examples?"

**"The content is too shallow"**
→ Say: "I need more technical depth. Can you provide more advanced explanations and challenging exercises?"

**"I'm lost on a concept"**
→ Say: "I don't understand [concept]. Can you explain it differently with a simple analogy and example?"

**"The exercises are too hard"**
→ Say: "This exercise is too challenging. Can you provide a simpler version and more guidance?"

**"I want to focus on specific areas"**
→ Say: "I want to spend more time on [topic]. Can we expand this section with more practice?"

### After the Course

- **Review your notes** - Consolidate what you learned
- **Do the final project** - This solidifies knowledge
- **Practice regularly** - Use it or lose it
- **Teach someone else** - Best way to verify understanding
- **Save the chat** - Reference it later
