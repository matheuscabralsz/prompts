# Examples

This directory contains complete examples of the project development workflow in action.

## What's in Here

Each example shows a realistic project that has gone through all phases of the workflow:

1. **initial-idea.md** - The filled-out project concept template
2. **planning.md** - The generated implementation plan with phases and dependencies
3. **PROGRESS.md** - The progress tracker showing implementation status
4. **.claude/CLAUDE.md** - The generated project-specific guidance for Claude Code

## Current Examples

### Todo App (`examples/todo-app/`)

A full-stack todo application demonstrating:
- Multiple implementation phases with clear dependencies
- Authentication and data persistence
- Frontend and backend coordination
- Quality gates and testing requirements
- Realistic progress tracking (some phases complete, some in progress)

**Key Takeaways**:
- See how a simple idea turns into a structured plan
- Notice how phases build on each other (auth → API → UI)
- Observe quality gates at each phase
- Check how PROGRESS.md tracks actual implementation status

## How to Use These Examples

### As a Learning Tool
1. Read through the workflow in order: initial-idea → planning → PROGRESS → CLAUDE.md
2. Notice how each document builds on the previous one
3. See how the CLAUDE.md provides specific, actionable guidance

### As a Template
1. Copy the structure for your own project
2. Use the same level of detail in your planning
3. Follow similar phase breakdown patterns
4. Adapt the CLAUDE.md format to your tech stack

### As a Reference
- Check how to write good phase descriptions
- See examples of explicit dependencies
- Learn how to define clear quality gates
- Understand appropriate granularity for tasks

## Contributing Examples

Want to add another example? Great! Follow these guidelines:

1. **Pick a realistic project**: Should be something you'd actually build
2. **Show the full workflow**: Include all 4 files (initial-idea, planning, PROGRESS, CLAUDE.md)
3. **Make it interesting**: Different tech stack or architecture than existing examples
4. **Show progress**: Don't make everything complete - show realistic in-progress state
5. **Be specific**: Use actual technologies, real phase names, concrete quality gates

## Example Ideas

Potential future examples to add:
- Mobile app (React Native or Flutter)
- CLI tool (Go or Rust)
- Data pipeline (Python + Apache Airflow)
- Chrome extension (JavaScript)
- Discord bot (Node.js)
- Game (Unity or Godot)

Each example should showcase different aspects of the workflow and different technology stacks.
