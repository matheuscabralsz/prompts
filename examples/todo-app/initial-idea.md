# Initial Idea: Simple Todo App

## Project Vision
A clean, user-friendly todo application that helps people organize their daily tasks with user authentication and persistence.

## Core Features
1. **User Authentication**
   - Sign up with email/password
   - Login/logout functionality
   - Session management

2. **Todo Management**
   - Create new todos with title and description
   - Mark todos as complete/incomplete
   - Edit existing todos
   - Delete todos
   - Filter by status (all/active/completed)

3. **Data Persistence**
   - Save todos to database
   - Associate todos with user accounts
   - Maintain state across sessions

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS

## Architecture
- RESTful API design
- Separate frontend and backend codebases
- Client-side routing with React Router
- Token-based authentication

## Quality Requirements
- **Testing**: Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints
- **Performance**: Page load under 2 seconds, API response under 200ms
- **Security**: Encrypted passwords, secure token storage, input validation
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, Prettier

## Success Criteria
- Users can create an account and log in
- Users can perform all CRUD operations on todos
- Todos persist across sessions
- All tests pass
- Build succeeds with no errors or warnings

## Out of Scope (v1)
- Todo sharing/collaboration
- Due dates and reminders
- Categories or tags
- Mobile app
- Email notifications
