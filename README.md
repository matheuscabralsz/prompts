# Prompts Repository

A collection of prompts designed to help vibe coding personal project ideas with AI assistance.

## What is Vibe Coding?

This repository provides a structured workflow for rapidly turning project ideas into reality using AI assistants like Claude Code. Instead of getting stuck in analysis paralysis, these prompts help you document your idea, plan implementation, and start coding quickly.

## Quick Start

### Project Development Workflow

1. **Capture your idea**: Fill out `project-development/0. initial-idea.md` in your project's docs/ folder as `initial-idea.md`
2. **Create a plan**: Use `project-development/1. planning.md` to generate implementation phases
3. **Setup tracking**: Use `project-development/2. progress-tracking.md` to create a progress tracker
4. **Generate guidance**: Use `project-development/3. create-claude-md.md` to create `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
5. **Start coding**: Begin implementation with full documentation in place

## Repository Structure

```
project-development/     # Main workflow for vibe coding projects
  ├── 0. initial-idea.md # Template for your project concept
  ├── 1. planning.md     # Generate implementation plan
  ├── 2. progress-tracking.md  # Create progress tracker
  └── 3. create-claude-md.md   # Generate CLAUDE.md guidance
```

## How It Works

Each prompt file follows a simple structure:
- **Purpose**: What it does
- **Pre-requirements**: What you need first
- **Prompt**: Copy and use with your AI assistant
- **Expected Output**: What you'll get

Start with `INITIAL_IDEA.md` and follow the numbered sequence. Each step builds on the previous one to get you coding faster.
